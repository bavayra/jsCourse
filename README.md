# jsCourse
That's my pandora box with exercises and projects I've been learning from JS Course by Simple Dev. 
Here I'm going step by step from the very basics to something okay-ish? 
There are several folders marked with numbers, so it's easier to see the progress. Alas, in this course HTML and CSS are not detailed or very well-planned, so almost all my excercises look very poor, boring and - sometimes - low quality because of that. 
Please lmk if you have any comments or whatever, I'd appreciate some feedback or mentoring!
